# Description

# Getting Started ðŸš€

### Prerequisites for running the Notebooks for the simulations

* <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/> Python 3.7 or Greater</a>
* <a href=https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/> pip 21.3.1 or Greater</a>

After installing the requirements, run the following commands in order

```bash
# creates python virtual environment for the project
python -m venv ./venv 

# activates virtual environment; this is on Mac or Linux
source ./venv/bin/activate 

# This is for windows (Using Powershell)
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat 

# upgrade pip to get the latest packages
python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

#Is used to check if the virtual environment is being used 
pip -V  

# Install all required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Cyclomatic Complexity

The cyclomatic complexity of the code can be tested using the following commands

``` bash
radon cc -a src 
```

## Using Password Strength to set password policy

This gives an easy method to set password policies for python projects (Password-strength. PyPI. (n.d.)).
Also, the entropy for the password policies can be set easily to achieve a stronger password.

``` python
from password_strength import PasswordPolicy

policy = PasswordPolicy.from_names(
    length=8,  # min length: 8
    uppercase=2,  # need min. 2 uppercase letters
    numbers=2,  # need min. 2 digits
    special=2,  # need min. 2 special characters
    nonletters=2,  # need min. 2 non-letter characters (digits, specials, anything)
)
policy.test('12345!')
```

### Commands for the application

``` bash
# Add-new-role
python src/main.py add-new-user-and-role --username-admin <CHANGE_USER> --password-admin <CHANGE_PASSWORD> --new-username <CHANGE_USER>--new-user-password <CHANGE_PASSWORD> --role NORMAL_USER

# list with token
 python src/main.py list-music-data  

 #list without token

python src/main.py update-music-data --username <CHANGE_USER> --password <CHANGE_PASSWORD>  --music-data-id <CHANGE_MUSIC_DATA_ID> --lyrics-file-path tests/files/test.txt  --music-score 2132 

# Delete music as normal user
python src/main.py delete-music-data --username <CHANGE_USER> --password <CHANGE_PASSWORD> --music-data-id <CHANGE_MUSIC_DATA_ID>

# Download data as an admin
python src/main.py download-music-data --username <CHANGE_USER> --password <CHANGE_USER> --music-data-id <CHANGE_MUSIC_DATA_ID>
```

### Run tests with coverage

To prove the

```bash
coverage run --source=src -m pytest -v tests && coverage report -m 

# Generate result in 
coverage html && open htmlcov/index.html  
```

### Libraries Used

| Library     | Description                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Typer       | Create the Entry Point for the CLI APP              |
| SQLModel    | ORM mapper for Python to interact with the database |
| PyJWT       | To Create JWT Tokens                                |
| argon2-cffi | To Hash data using Argon2                           |
| Pycrptdom   | To encrypt data using AES-256                       |

### Types of roles in the Project

Currently, there are only two types of roles in this application but can the roles can be extended
by modification of some code.

| Role id | Role Name   | Description                                              |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | ADMIN       | Is allowed to do all the actions                         |
| 2       | NORMAL_USER | Is only allowed to view/change items created by the user |

### JWT Tokens

The Jwt token store user claims like user id, expiry date, permissions (Jones, M., Bradley, J. and Sakimura, N., 2015).
This token is stored in a config when the users successfully logs-in. The token in this
application is only used for read actions, as this would give the user a better user experience
by not making them log-in multiple times to read data. However, for sensitive actions such as delete, modify, and add a
re-authentication is always required for each action.

#### JWT Signature Algorithm

To prevent tampering of data an asymmetric digital signature EdDSA using Ed25519 algorithm because of the following
reasons:

* This algorithm is lightweight and performant due to its small key sizes (64 or 114 bytes) and signatures (Josefsson,
  S. and Liusvaara, I., 2017).
* The algorithm is collision resilient.
* It provides protection against different kinds of attacks like side-channel analysis, differential power analysis
  attacks(Bisheh-Niasar, M et.al, 2021).
* It is a well renowned algorithm to apply digital signatures (Bisheh-Niasar, M et.al, 2021).

### Data Encryption

To ensure data confidentiality in the project, the data has to be encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm. As
the cryptographic algorithm, the symmetric key algorithm AES-256 is applied to encrypt the sensitive data.

This algorithm is chosen for the following reasons:

* AES-256 provides a good mixture of performance for memory, integrity and confidentiality (
  Mushtaq, M.F. et al. 2017).
* A good level of avalanche effect, making small changes in the data will change the encrypted text making it less
  predictable to break.
* Memory performance is essential for this application as binary data, such as audio files and lyrics, will also be
  encrypted, which is more memory intensive than small texts.
* AES-256 can resist quantum computing attacks based on shor's algorithm (Rao, S., Mahto et al. 201).

#### AES-256 Mode Selection

According to Hameed, M.E et al. 2019, Counter Mode(CTR) of AES encryption is the one of the best and most accepted block
ciphers modes. However, the CTR mode cannot prevent bit-flipping of by third person, but the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
an
extension of the CTR prevents its holding all the advantages of CTR, i.e. parallelization, integrtiy using
authentication, and performance (Satoh, A.,
2006). Therefore out of the different mode GCM is applied to this project.

###### Private Key and salt generation
Using Scrypt to generate human-readable private keys for AES-256 with GCM mode is selected
as it is a secure algorithm (Encryption and decryption with AES GCM (n.d))

### Data Integrity

The project handles the upload of various music data, such as audio and lyric files, which has to ensure that no
tampering within the database is
carried out. A checksum is calculated using the SHA-256 hash function(Rachmawati.D et al., 2018)to ensure that the data
inside the database are not tampered with for spoofing attacks.
